# Quick Password Fix

## ðŸ”§ Your Current Issue

Based on the logs, you have `ADMIN_PASSWORD` set in your `.env.local` file, but the client-side authentication needs `NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_PASSWORD`.

## âœ… Quick Fix

**Step 1:** Open your `.env.local` file

**Step 2:** Change this:
```bash
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your-password-here
```

**Step 3:** To this:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_PASSWORD=your-password-here
```

**Step 4:** Restart your dev server:
```bash
# Stop the server (Ctrl+C)
npm run dev
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Why This Fix is Needed

- `ADMIN_PASSWORD` = Server-side only (not accessible to browser)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_PASSWORD` = Client-side accessible (works in browser)

Since the login form runs in your browser, it needs the `NEXT_PUBLIC_` version.

## âœ… After the Fix

1. Your custom password will work
2. No more debug info displayed
3. Rate limiting still active
4. Security maintained
