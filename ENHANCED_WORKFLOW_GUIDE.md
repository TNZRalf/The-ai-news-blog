# Enhanced Blog Workflow Guide

Your blog now automatically enhances all new articles to be more human-written, engaging, and interesting to read. This happens automatically when you run `npm run update-articles`.

## 🚀 New Enhanced Workflow

### Before (Old Workflow)
1. Add new content to `public/new blog content/`
2. Run `npm run update-articles`
3. Articles are added as-is (copy-paste content)

### After (New Enhanced Workflow)
1. Add new content to `public/new blog content/`
2. Run `npm run update-articles`
3. Articles are automatically enhanced with Llama/Gemma 3
4. Content becomes more human-written and engaging
5. Blog is ready with enhanced content

## 🎯 What the Enhancement Does

When you run `npm run update-articles`, the system now:

1. **Processes new articles** (migration, images, etc.)
2. **Identifies new articles** that were just added
3. **Enhances only new articles** through Gemma 3 (faster than enhancing all)
4. **Makes content more human-written**:
   - Conversational tone
   - Personal observations
   - Better flow and readability
   - Engaging storytelling
   - Clear, concise language
5. **Replaces content** with enhanced version
6. **Creates backups** for safety

## 📋 Example Transformation

**Before Enhancement:**
```
A new drug usually starts with a tragedy. Peter Ray knows that. Born in what is now Zimbabwe, the child of a mechanic and a radiology technician, Ray fled with his family to South Africa during the Zimbabwean War of Liberation.
```

**After Enhancement:**
```
Let me tell you about Peter Ray's journey - it's one of those stories that really hits home. You see, every breakthrough drug has a human story behind it, and Peter's story begins with a tragedy that would shape his entire career. Born in what's now Zimbabwe to a mechanic father and radiology technician mother, his family's escape to South Africa during the Zimbabwean War of Liberation marked the beginning of a path that would lead to groundbreaking medical discoveries.
```

## 🎨 Customization Options

### Adjust Enhancement Style

```javascript
const ENHANCEMENT_PROMPT = `You are a skilled content writer and editor. Your task is to rewrite the following article content to make it more human-written, engaging, and interesting to read. 

Guidelines:

- Make it sound like it was written by someone passionate about the topic

Original article title: {title}
Original content: {content}

```

### Change Model
Edit the `CONFIG` object in `scripts/enhance-articles-with-llama.js`:

```javascript
const CONFIG = {
  // ... other settings ...
  llamaArgs: [
    'run', 'gemma3:4b' // Change to any model: llama2:7b, gemma2:2b, etc.
  ],
  // ... other settings ...
};
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Enhancement Fails
- Check if Ollama is running: `ollama serve`
- Verify model is available: `ollama list`
- Check system resources (RAM, GPU)

### No Enhancement Happening
- Ensure new articles were actually added
- Check console output for error messages
- Verify Gemma 3 model is downloaded

- Try different models (llama2:7b, gemma2:2b)
- Modify temperature and other parameters
